# n8n@0.214.0
View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.213.0...n8n@0.214.0) for this version.  
**Release date**: 2023-01-27 L0rdShrek/HA-addons#102  
This release contains new features, node enhancements, and bug fixes. The expressions editor now supports autocomplete for some built in data transformation functions. The new features also include two of interest to node builders: a way to allow users to drag and drop data keys, and the new HTML editor component.

## New features
- Core: export OpenAPI spec for external tools.
- Core: set custom Cache-Control headers for static assets.
- Core: simplify pagination in declarative node design.
- Editor: support mapping keys with drag and drop. Any field with the hint Enter the field name as text should now support mapping a data key using drag and drop. Node builders can enable this in their own nodes. Refer to Creating nodes | UI elements for more information.
- Editor: add the HTML editor component for use in parameters. This means node builders can now use the HTML editor that n8n uses in the HTML node as a UI component.
- Editor: append expressions in fixed values when mapping to string and JSON inputs.
- Editor: autocompletion for extensions in the expression editor.
- Editor: continue to show mapping tooltip after dismiss.
