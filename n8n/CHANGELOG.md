**Release date**: 2022-12-27  L0rdShrek/HA-addons#81  
This is primarily a bug fix release.  

## üêõ Bug fixes
- Core: don't send credentials to browser console.
- Core: permit a workflow user who isn't the owner to use their own credentials.
- Editor: fix for loading executions that aren't on the current executions list.
- Editor: make the tertiary button on the Usage page transparent.
- Editor: update credential owner warning when sharing.

## New features
- Editor: Improve UX for brace completion in the inline expressions editor.

## üß∞ Node enhancements 
Webhook node: when test the node by selecting Listen For Test Event then dispatching a call to the webhook, n8n now only runs the Webhook node. Previously, n8n ran the entire workflow. You can still test the full workflow by selecting Execute Workflow, then dispatching a test call.
