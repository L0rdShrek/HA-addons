## New features
- Add new event hooks to support telemetry around the new onboarding experience.
- Update nodes to set required path type.
- Core: add configurable execution history limit. Use this to improve performance when self-hosting. Refer to Execution Data | Enable data pruning for more information.
- Core: add execution runData recovery and status field. This allows us to show execution statuses on the Executions list.
- Core: add SAML feature flag. This is preparatory for an upcoming feature.
- Editor: improvements to the nodes panel search. When searching in root view, n8n now displays results from both trigger and regular nodes. When searching in a category view, n8n shows results from the category, and also suggests results from other categories.
- Hide sensitive value in authentication header credentials and authentication query credentials.
- Support feature flag evaluation server side.
