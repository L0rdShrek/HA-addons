View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.221.2...n8n@0.222.0) for this version.  
**Release date**: 2023-04-04 L0rdShrek/HA-addons#134  
This release contains new features, including custom filters for the executions list, and a new node to filter items in your workflows.  

## New features
This release introduces improvements to the execution lists. You can now save Custom execution data, and use it to filter both the All executions and Single workflow executions lists.  
- Add test overrides.
- Core: Improve LDAP/SAML toggle and tests.
- Core: Limit user invites when SAML is enabled.
- Core: Make OAuth2 error handling consistent with success handling.

## New nodes
This release introduces the Filter node. The node allows you to filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.
